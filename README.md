üëã Hows it going! Im Dylan and welcome to my Github! Ive been recently focusing on my game dev passion project in unreal engine but if you look through past projects Ive mainly either worked on Unity games, game jams with a few non-game dev related projects such as a hackathon or two. I love coding and making games, recently Ive been trying my hand in unreal so future repos may be more unreal focused (still love unity dont worry!). I have aspirations of one day finding a careering doing what I love with game dev.

### Public Projects of Note
- [Last Array in Unreal](https://github.com/dloe/TheLastArray_UnrealPort) - My current big project mentioned earlier is my unreal passion project, where I am recreating the Last Array from Unity to Unreal Engine 5 where I plan to optimize, redesign and push my game dev to its limit to create something awesome! Getting more experience in my C++ and blueprint knowledge.
- [Last Array in Unity](https://github.com/dloe/TheLastArray) - Undergrad senior capstone project: The Last Array where we made a rouge-lite in Unity, worked with a bunch of good friends and had alot of fun doing it! I was mainly in charge of the random tile generation system which turned out really good!
- [Stride Game Engine](https://github.com/stride3d/stride/commits?author=dloe) - I also periodically contribute to Stride Game Engine, an open source project. So far Ive covered issues pertaining to issues in the game editor, UI (UWP Application) and their old physics engine (Bullet). Getting more expereince in my .Net and C# knowledge and collaborting with the fantastic open source team over there. Plan to contribute and help on issues as I find time outside of my passion project. If you want to support them check them out [here](https://www.stride3d.net/).
